## Project description
The original program could register a user, add a task, view all tasks, view logged-in user's task and display basic task statistics. 
The requirements where to improve readability via abstraction, allow the logged-in user to edit one of their tasks (change due date or mark as complete) and generate user + task overviews. The original code also required validation for all existing choices to prevent user inputs causing errors. Some options where changed to admin only, so the option to change the logged-in user was additionally added.

## Installation
This program requires no additional packages to be installed
